# GeneticsReborn 1.12-1.12.2 Patched
This branch is patch version.

Different form original
- virus negative potion effects works imminently
- fix Airborne Dispersal Device block issued(some function changed)
- add Levitation DNA recipe(shulker has it but potion effect unimplemented..)

A remake of the loved Advanced Genetics mod from 1.7.10

For how to get started check out the wiki page! This mod does not add any power gen as of writing this, so you will need to have another mod that generates FE(Forge Energy) power such as Extra Utilities, Ender IO, Extreme Reactors, etc. etc.
Also check out the main thread here-http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2782810-genetics-reborn-the-unofficial-remake-of-advanced

## Disclaimer:    
I did not use any textures, code, or other material from the Advanced Genetics mod. I haven't ever looked into its source code or API and never plan to. All of this mod was made using the ideas from the orginal 1.7.10 mod, but almost all the code and textures were made by me, excluding the few things gotten from tutorials and/or other open source mods.
